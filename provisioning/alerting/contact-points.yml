# Grafana Contact Points — Auto-provisioned
# Webhook-based contact point for alert notifications.
#
# To activate notifications, set ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL on the Grafana service
# in Render (e.g., a Slack Incoming Webhook or Discord webhook URL).
# Without this env var, alerts still fire and appear in the Grafana UI
# but no external notifications are sent.
